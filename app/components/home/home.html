                CASCADE aides analysts in hunting advanced cyber adversaries,
                by using MITRE's <strong>ATT&amp;CK</strong> framework.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                CASCADE automates significant portions of the investigation process, and identifies
                ATT&CK techniques. Context is automatically gathered and graphs of activity
                are labelled with ATT&amp;CK data, allowing analysts can focus efforts on making intelligent
                decisions, response and remediation.
