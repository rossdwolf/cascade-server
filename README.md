# CASCADE
CASCADE is a research project at MITRE that automates much of the investigative work a "blue-team" team
would perform to determine the scope and maliciousness of suspicious behavior on a network using host data.

This fork returns static content for the backend APIs, but is still highly explorable within a web browser.
The full version is maintained on MITRE's [repository](https://github.mitre.org/cascade-server)
